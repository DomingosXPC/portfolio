## App Design from Scratch

> Introducing the digital age

In the world of printed books, GoldenBook was well-loved for its trusted recommendations. But as the world embraced the digital age, they are missing out on a big opportunity. Goldenbook has around <strong> 3.5 million readers a year.</strong> Pocket book guides are out of fashion and not having a digital platform to serve this enormous user base is costing them a tremendous profit opportunity.


To fix this, I came up with an app idea: a modern and <strong>high-quality pocket guide.</strong> It's been approved and is waiting for funding. This app aims to <strong> position GoldenBook competitively in the digital world</strong> and expand their revenue source. 

<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> If readers were given a digital platform on which they could have goldenbook's guidance, they would use it daily during their stay.

Proposed solution (with a <strong>Most Valuable Product):</strong>
- Create a digital community with exclusive advantages.
- Bridge client with location by offering contact information and brief overview.
- Allow free navigation but also filtered and categorized.
- Offer elegant, intuitive, and clean platform.
- Make accessible the latest book editions (by download).

### Research

My research first centered around the competition space in order to understand how other apps explored the opportunity. 

More than 100 user survey responses would help quantify what customers are looking for, and what they’re hoping to resolve. And lastly, one-on-one interviews would help me understand users’ journeys and specific issues the app would need to address.

<strong>Findings:</strong>
- No direct competition, but several attempts at providing travel recommendations.
- Users were highly dependent of reviews and ratings to decide where to go.
- Finding quality recommendations was an issue for all.
- Decision making was “hard” and “felt risky” for most users, for the lack of a reliable quality guide.
- Only 5% resorted to book pocket guides.


### Getting Closer to User-Centered Design

As research and design proceeded, I focused primarily on one persona because he represented an array of characteristics that identified the target user. This persona emphasized to the inconvenience of a physical book guide and the benefits of having a go-to source at anytime.

#### Heighten User Empathy

By creating and exploring the journey maps of my persona I uncovered key emotional/procedural moments that Goldenbook needed to address. 

The anxiety someone might feel, for example, for not knowing what to do or how to contact and navigate to a desired location. To ensure the app’s stickiness, it would need to overcome these problems … and not introduce new points of friction.

#### Creating structure

The sitemap informed by surveys and interviews, organizationally depicts the three key tasks that the high fidelity prototype would focus on: 1. Onboarding and registration, 2. Search page browsing and decision making, and 3. Obtaining contact information. The framework the site map provides, along with the user insight collected this far, would guide design decisions moving forward.

#### Understanding What Users Find Intuitive

Low-fidelity prototype testing allowed me to better understand how users expected to complete the tasks I was focusing on. By studying their touch and swipe gestures — and more importantly, having a dialogue with them about what they expected and when — I knew which adjustments needed to be made to lay the foundation for a more fully realized high fidelity prototype. Small details such as consistent paths to get back, swipe or click mechanics, would become important elements.


#### Surfacing new issues

The high-fidelity prototype brought test users closest to the real experience yet, and it revealed some issues. While users were able to complete the onboarding experience, the realistic nature of it revealed some apprehension. Security, privacy, what happens if they forgot their passwords … these were among the topics raised by test subjects.

They were also able to verbalize a need they hadn’t thought of before this iteration: Could the app somehow make recommendations in compliance with a busy calendar and other personal conditionals like eating regimen — Yet another piece of information that could empower them to make better decisions and increase the product's stickiness.

##### Prototype tasks
<strong> Task 1: </strong> Successfully create an account with Email and onboard the app.

<strong> Task 2: </strong> Get the contact details of "Tin Goods Snack Shop".

#### How the app can be Improved

Issues and Opportunities to address for longer-term development:

<strong>Offer and revenue:</strong>
- Goldenbooking: Expand partnerships to provide users with exclusive discounts when booking directly from the app, of any kind (restaurants, hotels, etc.). This would provide a cheaper reservation price to the user and a lower CPA (cost per acquisition) to the client, considering it’d be below the rates of the most used services. This win-win solution would put money in everyone’s pocket.
- Featuring special events, products or clients. This would increase the revenue source of the app.
- Establish partnerships to provide with full-day/week itineraries. 

<strong>Usability:</strong>
- Allow users to see what’s close to them on a map.
- Advanced filtering functions to fine tune viewing options based on user preferences.
