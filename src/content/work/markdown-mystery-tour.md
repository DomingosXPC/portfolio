## Website Revamp


> The Result? Lead Overflow

My client is a Web Design & Coding School located in Manhattan Beach. They’re goal is to train as many students as they can into becoming successful IT professionals. On their website, engagement and active users had been declining gradually overtime.

I worked alongside the development team to deliever a revamped version of the website that achieved: <strong>Bounce Rate (-52%)</strong>, <strong> Exit Rate (-46%)</strong>, <strong>Lead Conversion Rate (+1300%)</strong>, <strong>Returning Visitors (+167%)</strong>.

### Background

Through their previous website, my clients were trying to inform and captivate prospective students. It was visually outdated and had fallen behind in this ever evolving industry.

### Insights

I gathered and analyzed the numbers that would tell me how the website was being used and if it was fulfilling the needs of the users.

Based on data results, bounce rate on the homepage was 58%. Of the remaining users, 36% would exit on a different page. The online enrollment had reported no conversions in the last three months and the lead magnet a 2% conversion rate. Only 9% of the users were returning to the website.

I stated not only was the website not engaging enough, the users couldn’t find the information they needed.

#### User Insights

By interviewing, researching and testing various elements in the past, I gained valuable insights that informed my design decisions. Most importantly:

- Displaying the course instructors, school reviews and financial options available is a highly effective way to establish authority and credibility. These features consistently resonate with the users.
- Highlighting metrics like salary, pass rates, and placement rates, engages users who are seeking to make significant changes in their lives through courses. Providing users with tangible data allows them to envision their potential success, resulting in a better experience that reinforces their motivations.
- Making clear the course outline and skills taught helps students understand how the course will help launch to their future careers.

#### Revamped Design

I came up with a design that would make the school shine as a trustworthy authority in the industry. I did so with content, color, typography, images and interactive elements.

#### Conclusion

Through data analysis and user insights, valuable lessons were learned that informed a successful redesign strategy.

The new website, featuring visually appealing and user-friendly elements, significantly reduced bounce rate (-52%) and exit rate (-46%). Lead conversion rate soared (+1300%), and returning visitors increased notably (+167%).

Key learnings include the importance of displaying vital information and clear communication of the course outline and skills taught to establish credibility and engage potential students.

The revamped website successfully revitalized the school's online presence, capturing the attention of prospective students. Continuous monitoring and data-driven refinements are recommended for further optimization.

In summary, the website revamp achieved impressive results, solidifying the school's leadership in the industry.
