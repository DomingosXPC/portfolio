## Website Revamp


> The Result? Lead Overflow

My clients are a Web Design & Coding School located in Manhattan Beach. Theyâ€™re goal is to train as many students as they can into becoming successful IT professionals. On their website, engagement and active users had been declining gradually overtime.

I worked alongside the development team to deliever a revamped version of the website that achieved: <strong>Bounce Rate (-52%)</strong>, <strong> Exit Rate (-46%)</strong>, <strong>Lead Conversion Rate (+1300%)</strong>, <strong>Returning Visitors (+167%)</strong>.

### Background

Through their previous website, my clients were trying to inform and captivate prospective students. It was visually outdated and had fallen behind in this ever evolving industry.

### Data Analysis

I analyzed the website's performance and user behavior. The findings indicate several areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the bounce rate on the homepage is quite high at 58%, suggesting that a significant number of users leave the site without further engagement. Additionally, 36% of the remaining users exit the website from different pages, indicating difficulties in finding the desired information.

Furthermore, the online enrollment feature has not yielded any conversions in the past three months, and the lead magnet has achieved a conversion rate of only 2%. Moreover, the rate of returning users is quite low, with only 9% revisiting the website.

These findings suggest that the website lacks engagement and fails to meet the information needs of users. Addressing these issues is crucial to improve user experience and achieve better results.

#### User Insights

By interviewing, researching and testing various elements, I gained valuable insights that informed my design decisions. Most importantly:

- Displaying the course instructors, school reviews and financial options available is a highly effective way to establish authority and credibility. These features consistently resonate with the users.
- Highlighting metrics like salary, pass rates, and placement rates, engages users who are seeking to make significant changes in their lives through courses. Providing users with tangible data allows them to envision their potential success, resulting in a better experience that reinforces their motivations.
- Making clear the course outline and skills taught helps students understand how the course will help launch to their future careers.

#### Revamped Design

I came up with a design that would make the school shine as a trustworthy authority in the industry. I did so with content, color, typography, images and interactive elements.

#### Conclusion

Through data analysis and user insights, valuable lessons were learned that informed a successful redesign strategy.

The new website, featuring visually appealing and user-friendly elements, significantly reduced bounce rate (-52%) and exit rate (-46%). Lead conversion rate soared (+1300%), and returning visitors increased notably (+167%).

Key learnings include the importance of displaying vital information and clear communication of the course outline and skills taught to establish credibility and engage potential students.

The revamped website successfully revitalized the school's online presence, capturing the attention of prospective students. Continuous monitoring and data-driven refinements are recommended for further optimization.

In summary, the website revamp achieved impressive results, solidifying the school's leadership in the industry.
