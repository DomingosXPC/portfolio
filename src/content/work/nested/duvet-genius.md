## Top Funnel Campaign Design


> The Leads Kept Comming

My client is an Insurancy Agency based in Ohio. They’re goal was to convert prospects into leads by redisigning their website and also promote their commercial-auto insurance service with google ads.

I worked alongisde the Marketing Strategist and the Development team to deliever a campaign that achieved: <strong>Lead Conversion Rate (21%)</strong> , <strong> Cost Per Acquisition ($36)</strong>, <strong> Leads Generated (278)</strong>.

#### Client Acquisition Process

Initially, we had no data points to analyze, so I worked closely with the Marketing Strategist to develop a strategy for gathering information about the consumer’s buying cycle, agency’s sales process, competitive advantages, and unique strengths.

To accomplish this, we prepared a discovery sheet document which contained the questions that would allow us to get a “10,000 foot view” of their business. We also interviewed key stakeholders, including the agency CEO and Founder, a senior agent, and five end consumers, to gain a wider perspective of the service.

#### User Persona

As it’s the insurance line with the most interest for the agency, our main user would be looking for commercial-auto insurance.

#### Wireframes

I designed quick wireframes of the website, and landing page that we would use for the Google Ads campaign. The user journey had to be intuitive and straightforward so I made clear what the benefits of hiring the agency were and designed a repeatable symbol that the user would recognize and be called to act on.

#### Hi-Fi Design

After validating the wireframes with the Marketing Strategist and with the Client, I proceeded to design with detail, centered on the user and the client’s existing branding guidelines.

#### Homepage Hero & Conversion Symbol

25% of the leads generated on the website was through the hero section, while 60% was through the repeatable conversion symbol. This KPIs told us that the website was being used as expected, and was very effective.

#### Ads Landing Page

The landing page was created to align with the ads that were focused on a different journey stage. At this stage the user would be in a comparative mindset and would require a more engaging webpage, that would not only captivate their interest but also answer their need for a quote quickly.  On this landing page the user converted nearly 86% of the times through the hero section.

#### Google Ads Campaign Setup

As the Head SEM Specialist, I’ve put together a campaign from scratch that obtained outstanding results. To thrive on a highly competitive market, I’ve made an extensive market and keyword research.

To stay away from the industry giants as much as possible, I’ve developed a long trail keyword list that targeted our user on a specific stage and query. After generating enough keywords, I’ve separated them into three different ad groups and adapted the copy to achieve an optimal quality score and reduce auction costs. On a dense market like insurance, being cost effective is crucial.

The campaign achieved 22% conversion rate, 9% CTR and $36 CPA.

#### Conclusion

By combining UX/UI design, search engine marketing, and market research, we executed a highly effective campaign targeting the "top of the funnel" for an Insurance Company. Through a website revamp and strategic Google Ads promotion, we achieved outstanding results, including a 21% lead conversion rate, $36 cost per acquisition, and 278 leads generated. 

Valuable insights gained from this project emphasize the significance of user-centric design, personalized landing pages, and thorough market and keyword research.
